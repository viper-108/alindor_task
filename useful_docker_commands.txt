Docker commands to use the docker container - 

1. After creating a Dockerfile we have to build a docker image using Dockerfile - 

    docker build -t allindor_app .

2. Testing our docker Image locally - 

    docker run -p 8080:8080 allindor_app

3. After testing our docker Image, we have to tag docker Image -

    docker tag allindor_app gcr.io/calm-cairn-292101/allindor_app

4. After tagging our docker image we have to pust it to GCR - 

    docker push gcr.io/calm-cairn-292101/allindor_app

5. After pusing it to GCR we have to deploy it, for that we can use the command of deploy_google_cloud_run.sh
